Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the question is about what happens to the kidney parenchyma when there's chronic urethral obstruction caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia. The options are hyperplasia, hypertrophy, atrophy, or dysplasia.

First, I need to recall what each term means. Hyperplasia is an increase in the number of cells, leading to an enlarged organ. Hypertrophy is an increase in the size of cells, which also makes the organ bigger. Atrophy is the opposite—cells shrink, leading to a decrease in organ size. Dysplasia refers to abnormal cell growth, which can be a precursor to cancer.

Now, the scenario here is a chronic urethral obstruction. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is when the prostate gland enlarges, which can compress the urethra, making it hard to urinate. If this obstruction is chronic, the urine can't flow out properly, leading to increased pressure in the urinary tract. Over time, this back pressure can affect the kidneys. 

When the kidneys are under increased pressure due to obstruction, the nephrons (the functional units) might be damaged. If the obstruction is long-standing, the nephrons can't function properly. The persistent pressure and possible backup of urine can cause the kidney tissue to waste away. This is because the cells aren't getting the proper environment to survive—maybe due to ischemia (lack of blood flow) from the pressure, or the cells are damaged by the backed-up urine. 

So, the kidney parenchyma would undergo atrophy in this case. The cells would shrink and die over time because of the chronic obstruction. Hyperplasia and hypertrophy are more about growth responses, but here the problem is a destructive process. Dysplasia is about abnormal cells, which isn't the primary issue here unless there's some metaplasia first, but that's not mentioned. 

Wait, but sometimes when there's an obstruction, the initial response might be hypertrophy of the bladder muscles as they try to push urine out. But the question is about the kidney parenchyma. If the obstruction is in the urethra, the back pressure would affect the kidneys. The kidneys' response to obstruction is hydronephrosis, where the renal pelvis and calyces dilate. The increased pressure can compress the renal parenchyma, leading to thinning and atrophy. So over time, the functional tissue (parenchyma) atrophies. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be C. Atrophy.

The chronic obstruction caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia leads to increased pressure in the urinary tract, which is transmitted back to the kidneys. This back pressure results in hydronephrosis, where the renal pelvis and calyces dilate, compressing the kidney parenchyma. Over time, the persistent pressure causes ischemic damage and loss of nephrons, leading to **atrophy** of the kidney parenchyma. Hyperplasia and hypertrophy involve cellular growth, which is not the primary response here, and dysplasia refers to abnormal precancerous changes, which are unrelated.

P 640* Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) is synthesized solely by microorganisms.* In humans, the only source for humans is food of animal origin, e.g., meat, fish, and dairy products.* Vegetables, fruits, and other foods of nonanimal origin doesn't contain Vitamin B12 .* Daily requirements of vitamin Bp is about 1-3 pg. Body stores are of the order of 2-3 mg, sufficient for 3-4 years if supplies are completely cut off.",deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1,C,"<think>
Okay, so the question is asking which vitamin comes only from animal sources. The options are A through D: Vitamin C, B7, B12, and D. Let me think about each one.

First, Vitamin C. I remember that citrus fruits like oranges and lemons are high in Vitamin C. Also, vegetables like bell peppers and broccoli have it. So Vitamin C is definitely found in plants. That means option A isn't the right answer.

Next, Vitamin B7, which I think is also called biotin. I recall that biotin is found in foods like eggs, but also in nuts, seeds, and some vegetables like spinach. So it's available from both animal and plant sources. So B7 (option B) probably isn't the correct answer either.

Then there's Vitamin B12. From what I've learned, B12 is a bit tricky. It's mainly found in animal products like meat, fish, eggs, and dairy. I've heard that plant-based sources are scarce, and that's why vegans often need to take supplements or eat fortified foods. Some fortified cereals or nutritional yeast might have B12 added, but naturally, it's not present in plants. So Vitamin B12 (option C) seems like a strong candidate here.

Lastly, Vitamin D. The primary source is sunlight exposure, but dietary sources include fatty fish, liver, egg yolks, and fortified foods like milk or orange juice. So while some Vitamin D comes from animal products, there are fortified plant-based options. However, natural plant sources are limited. Wait, but the question says ""only animal source."" If fortified foods are considered, then Vitamin D can come from non-animal sources. But maybe the question is referring to natural sources. Hmm. For example, mushrooms can produce Vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. So if mushrooms count as a plant source, then Vitamin D isn't exclusively from animals. But I'm not sure if that's considered a natural source. This might be a point of confusion.

So between C and D. The key is which one is only from animal sources. B12 is not naturally present in plants, so unless fortified, you can't get it from plants. Vitamin D can be obtained from sunlight, but dietary sources are mostly animal-based except for fortified foods and mushrooms. The question might be considering natural dietary sources. If that's the case, then B12 is the one that's only from animals. Because even mushrooms (a plant source) can have D when exposed to UV light. So the answer is C. Vitamin B12.
</think>

The correct answer is **C. Vitamin B12** because it is naturally found only in animal products such as meat, fish, eggs, and dairy. Plant-based sources of B12 are typically fortified or synthetic, not naturally occurring. While Vitamin D can be synthesized by the body via sunlight and found in fortified plant foods, B12 lacks natural plant sources.
