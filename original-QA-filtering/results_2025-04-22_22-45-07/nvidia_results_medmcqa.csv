P950",deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1,C,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the question is about what happens to the kidney parenchyma when there's chronic urethral obstruction caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia. The options are hyperplasia, hypertrophy, atrophy, or dysplasia.

First, I need to recall what each of these terms means. Hyperplasia is an increase in the number of cells, leading to an enlarged organ. Hypertrophy is an increase in the size of the cells, which also makes the organ bigger. Atrophy is the oppositeâ€”cells shrink, leading to a decrease in organ size. Dysplasia refers to abnormal cell growth, which can be a precursor to cancer, but that's more about disordered development rather than a response to obstruction.

Now, the scenario here is chronic urethral obstruction. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common cause in older men. The prostate enlarges and compresses the urethra, making it hard to urinate. If this obstruction is chronic, the urine can't flow out properly, leading to increased pressure in the urinary tract. Over time, this back pressure affects the kidneys. 

When the kidneys are under increased pressure due to obstruction, the nephrons (the functional units) might be damaged. The persistent pressure can cause the kidney tissue to waste away because the nephrons are being destroyed. This process is called atrophy. The kidney parenchyma, which includes the nephrons and surrounding structures, would shrink over time due to the ongoing damage from the obstruction. 

Wait, but sometimes when there's an obstruction, the affected area might initially have some hypertrophy. For example, if a part of the urinary tract is blocked, the muscles in the bladder might hypertrophy to push urine past the obstruction. But in the kidneys, the prolonged obstruction leads to hydronephrosis, which is the swelling of the kidney due to urine buildup. However, if the obstruction is chronic and not relieved, the continued pressure leads to compression and damage of the kidney tissue, leading to atrophy rather than hypertrophy. 

So, hyperplasia would be an increase in cell number, but in this case, the cells are being damaged and dying, so the number would decrease. Hypertrophy is cell enlargement, but again, the damage here is more about cell loss. Dysplasia isn't related to mechanical obstruction; it's more about cellular changes due to dysplasia, which isn't the case here. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be atrophy. The kidney parenchyma undergoes atrophy due to the chronic pressure and damage from the obstruction.

The chronic obstruction caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia leads to increased pressure in the urinary tract, damaging kidney nephrons. Persistent pressure results in tissue wasting and loss of functional parenchyma, a process termed **atrophy**. Hyperplasia (cell proliferation) and hypertrophy (cell enlargement) are growth responses not applicable here, while dysplasia (abnormal cell development) is unrelated to mechanical obstruction.

e3d3c4e1-4fb2-45e7-9f88-247cc8f373b3,medmcqa,Which vitamin is supplied from only animal source:,C,"Ans. (c) Vitamin B12 Ref: Harrison's 19th ed. P 640* Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) is synthesized solely by microorganisms.* In humans, the only source for humans is food of animal origin, e.g., meat, fish, and dairy products.* Vegetables, fruits, and other foods of nonanimal origin doesn't contain Vitamin B12 .* Daily requirements of vitamin Bp is about 1-3 pg. Body stores are of the order of 2-3 mg, sufficient for 3-4 years if supplies are completely cut off.",deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1,C,"<think>
Okay, so the question is asking which vitamin comes only from animal sources. The options are A to D. Let me think about each one.

First, Vitamin C. I remember that citrus fruits like oranges and lemons are high in Vitamin C. Also, vegetables like bell peppers and broccoli have it. So Vitamin C is definitely found in plants. That means option A isn't the right answer.

Next, Vitamin B7, which is biotin. I think biotin is found in a variety of foods. Eggs are a source, but also nuts, seeds, and some vegetables like sweet potatoes. So B7 isn't exclusive to animals. So B is out.

Then, Vitamin B12. I've heard that B12 is a tricky one. From what I recall, plant-based sources don't naturally have B12. It's mainly found in meat, fish, eggs, and dairy. People who follow a vegan diet often need to take supplements or eat fortified foods because they can't get B12 from plants. So C might be the correct answer.

Lastly, Vitamin D. The primary source is sunlight, but dietary sources include fatty fish, liver, and egg yolks. Some mushrooms can provide Vitamin D if they're exposed to UV light. Also, fortified foods like milk or cereals (which might be plant-based) can have Vitamin D added. So D isn't exclusively from animals. So the answer should be C, Vitamin B12.
</think>

The correct answer is C. Vitamin B12 is naturally found in significant amounts only in animal products such as meat, fish, eggs, and dairy. Plant-based sources do not provide adequate B12 unless fortified.

Okay, let's tackle this question. The question is asking which of the listed options is NOT a surgical procedure for morbid obesity. The options are A through D.

First, I need to recall the different types of bariatric surgeries. Let me list them out. There's the adjustable gastric banding, which I think is where they put a band around the stomach to make it smaller. That's definitely a surgical option, so A is a valid procedure. So A is not the answer.

Then there's Biliopancreatic diversion, which I remember is a more complex surgery that involves removing part of the stomach and rerouting the intestines. That's B. I think that's a real procedure, so B is a valid option. So B is not the exception.

Duodenal Switch, option C. Wait, isn't that similar to the biliopancreatic diversion? Oh right, the duodenal switch is a type of biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD/DS). So C is a recognized surgery. So C is not the answer either.

Now D: Roux en Y Duodenal Bypass. Hmm. Wait, the common one is Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. But the question here says ""Duodenal By pass"". Wait, maybe that's a typo? Or maybe it's a different procedure. Let me think. The standard Roux-en-Y gastric bypass involves creating a small stomach pouch and connecting it directly to the small intestine, bypassing most of the stomach and the duodenum. But the name here is ""Roux en Y Duodenal Bypass"". Is that a real term? Or is the correct term Roux-en-Y gastric bypass? Because if the option D is named differently, maybe it's a trick. Alternatively, maybe the duodenal switch is part of the BPD/DS, which does involve a duodenal bypass. Wait, but the options are separate. So if D is a different procedure, perhaps it's not a standard one. Wait, the standard procedures are gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy, adjustable gastric band, and BPD/DS. So the Roux-en-Y is the gastric bypass. If option D is called Roux en Y Duodenal Bypass, maybe that's a made-up term or a confusion. Because the duodenum is part of the bypass in the standard RYGB, but the name isn't usually phrased that way. So perhaps D is not a real procedure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is D because the correct term is Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, not duodenal bypass. So the exception would be D. Therefore, the answer is D.
</think>

The question asks which option is not a surgical procedure for morbid obesity. Here's the breakdown:

- **A. Adjustable gastric banding**: A valid procedure involving a band around the stomach.  
- **B. Biliopancreatic diversion**: A recognized surgery that reroutes the intestines.  
- **C. Duodenal Switch**: Part of the BPD/DS procedure, a legitimate option.  
- **D. Roux en Y Duodenal By pass**: The standard term is *Roux-en-Y gastric bypass*; ""Duodenal Bypass"" is not a standard name for this procedure, making this option incorrect.  

**Answer**: [D]",Correct
