      "******************** Question:\n",
      "I m extremely itchy all over my body, the itch happens mostly at night, and in my room. I have washed my sheets and and now even on a sheet-less air mattress. The itch occurs at all points of my day except when I am in the shower. Baby powder and cortisone doesn t help at all. The itch is mostly on my chest, thighs, arms, and hands (and avoids the pubic area). PLEASE HELP I don t have any sort of bites; but I have noticed that much of the itchy areas house small red dots, and when I get out of the shower, some areas of my skin get very red (but are relieved). \n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Hello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows \n",
      "Response:\n",
      "<START_WORKING_OUT>\n",
      "\n",
      "This sounds like a really frustrating and uncomfortable situation! It's good you're trying to pinpoint potential causes, especially with the lack of obvious irritants. Let’s break this down systematically. Given the symptoms – constant itching all over, primarily at night, in the bedroom, and with localized red dots, it's likely a combination of factors. Here’s a working plan to investigate:\n",
      "\n",
      "<SOLUTION>\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Rule Out Skin Infections:** While you’ve washed sheets, it's possible a secondary skin infection is occurring underneath the skin. Red dots could be a sign of a yeast or bacterial infection.  A dermatologist visit is strongly recommended to rule this out.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Allergic Reaction – Consider Sensitivities:** The fact that baby powder and cortisone aren't helping points towards a potential allergic reaction. Many people react to these ingredients. We need to explore potential sensitivities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Possible Contact Dermatitis:** The repeated exposure to the mattress, sheets, and air mattress could be contributing. Even without a rash, contact dermatitis (skin inflammation) is a possible cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Stress and Anxiety:** Since the itching is worse at night, and you’ve noted the red dots, stress and anxiety can significantly exacerbate itchiness.  It's crucial to consider this.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Underlying Skin Conditions:** While less likely given the description, conditions like eczema or psoriasis could be contributing, though the red dots don’t always indicate these.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Heat Sensitivity:** The fact that the red dots seem to be amplified when you get out of the shower could be linked to heat sensitivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Hydration & Diet:** Dehydration and changes in diet can sometimes impact skin health and itchiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Investigate the Red Dots:**  While not definitive, the red dots are worth noting. They could be a sign of something, but they don’t necessarily point to a specific diagnosis. A dermatologist can examine them and possibly perform a skin biopsy to determine their origin.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommended Next Steps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Consult a Dermatologist:** This is the most important step. They can properly diagnose the cause of the itching and recommend appropriate treatment.\n",
      "*   **Keep a Detailed Diary:** Track when the itching occurs, what you’ve eaten, any emotional stressors, and the products you use (even seemingly innocuous ones).\n",
      "*   **Avoid Irritants:** Temporarily discontinue use of baby powder and cortisone, and explore alternative bedding materials.\n",

I am nursing my husband 24hr   with help only to shower him...When I get up to him at night I feel dreadful and manage to land on the bed..Takes  few minutes to be able to tend to him...I get very angry about this hindrance,  which probably makes it worse. \n",

      "Hello dear, The symptoms as mentioned in your post can be due to \n",
      "Response:\n",
      "<start_working_out>\n",
      "This sounds like a complex situation involving a combination of physical discomfort, emotional distress, and potentially a cycle of feeling overwhelmed. Let's break down the potential issues and explore possible avenues for support. It appears you're experiencing significant challenges related to caring for your husband, potentially exacerbated by feelings of frustration and anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "<SOLUTION>\n",
      "It's crucial to address the underlying emotions driving your feelings. The constant \"swinging feeling,\" the fight against falling, and the nausea could be linked to several factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Physical Strain & Fatigue:**  The 24-hour shift, with minimal shower time and the physical demands of caring for a partner, is incredibly draining.  This can manifest as fatigue, nausea, and a general sense of being overwhelmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Emotional Distress:** The frustration and anger you describe are significant. You're feeling hindered, unable to provide adequate care, and struggling to cope with the emotional burden. This can contribute to heightened anxiety and reactivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Relationship Dynamics:** The lack of support from your husband and the feeling of being a \"nurse\" for him could be creating a power imbalance and potentially resentment. It’s important to explore this dynamic and consider if your needs are being met.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Potential Underlying Conditions:** While not definitively diagnosed, feelings of anxiety, depression, or even sensory processing issues could be contributing to these symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Prioritize Self-Care:** You're already attempting to care for your husband, which is commendable.  However, self-care is essential.  Even short breaks for yourself can make a difference.  This could include taking a warm bath, listening to calming music, or simply spending a few minutes in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Communicate with Your Husband:**  Express your feelings calmly and respectfully.  Explain how the situation is impacting you, rather than blaming him.  Focus on \"I\" statements (e.g., \"I feel overwhelmed when I have to do everything myself\").\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Seek Support:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    * **Therapist/Counselor:**  A therapist can help you process your emotions, develop coping mechanisms, and explore the root causes of your distress.\n",
      "    * **Support Groups:** Connecting with others who are facing similar challenges can be incredibly validating and provide practical advice.\n",
      "    * **Trusted Family/Friends:**  Reach out to someone you can trust for emotional support.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Consider Professional Guidance on Caregiving:**  If you’re feeling consistently overwhelmed, a geriatric care manager or social worker could offer practical strategies for managing caregiving responsibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Focus on Boundaries:** While you want to be supportive, setting boundaries is vital.  It is okay to say, \"I need a moment, I'll return when I'm feeling more centered.\"\n",

      "******************** Question:\n",
      "I have a ganglion cyst on my inner right wrist and I recently went to the doctor. He said that the only way for it to be gone is by doing surgery, due to the artery/vein that s near the cyst. I researched about this and I saw that I can smash or pop this stubborn thing with a Bible (it said it was cured that way) or a heavy book, but not as hard as if I were going to break my wrist. So, uh.. Tell me doc, can I save money and do the Bible Bash? \n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Ganglion cyst is collection of fluid/ viscous material near the tendon sheath or joint, it is because of the friction of tendon in the tendon sheath, the cyst like material will be gone once you press it but it again reaccumulates, i would recommend surgery if it is really bothering you, i.e. if you are having any pain or difficulty in doing activities, or if it is of cosmetic significance if not I will recommend leaving it alone, ganglion cyst go away if you smash or pop, but it again comes back because of the friction between tendon and its sheath, the only way for cure is surgery if it really bothers. \n",
      "Response:\n",
      "<start_working_out>\n",
      "Okay, this is a really concerning situation. You’re understandably worried and understandably facing a difficult decision. Let's break this down. The idea of smashing or popping a ganglion cyst with a Bible or heavy book is a very old remedy, popularized by anecdotal evidence and fringe beliefs. **Unfortunately, there's no scientific evidence to support the claim that this effectively removes ganglion cysts.** It’s more likely to cause bruising, pain, and potentially further inflammation.\n",
      "\n",
      "<SOLUTION>\n",
      "The \"Bible Bash\" method is not recommended. While it might seem appealing, it’s extremely risky and could lead to serious complications.  Here's a more practical approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Consult with your doctor *immediately*.** This is the most crucial step.  They need to assess the size, location, and symptoms of your ganglion cyst.  Discuss the risks and benefits of surgery versus alternative therapies.  They can determine if surgery is the best course of action for *your* specific case.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Explore non-surgical options:** Your doctor might recommend:\n",
      "   * **Corticosteroid injections:** These can reduce inflammation and pain, often providing temporary relief.\n",
      "   * **Physical therapy:**  Exercises and stretches can sometimes help to reduce the size or pressure on the cyst.\n",
      "   * **Compression:** Applying a snug compression bandage can help reduce pressure in the area, but it doesn't eliminate the cyst.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Surgery:** For a ganglion cyst, surgery is often the most effective way to remove it.  There are different surgical techniques, including:\n",
      "   * **Ligation:**  The cyst is tied off with sutures.\n",
      "   * **Crusting:**  The cyst is drained and then crusts over, eventually being absorbed by the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider the risk of complications**: Surgery carries risks, including infection, bleeding, nerve damage, and potential recurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bottom line:**  Don't rely on the Bible method.  Open and honest communication with your doctor is essential to creating a plan that's appropriate for your situation.  Don't underestimate the potential for pain and complications.\n",

      "Response:\n",
      "<START_WORKING_OUT>\n",
      "Okay, let’s break down this patient’s situation. The patient’s son has allergic asthma, is 3 years old, and is experiencing severe cough, pulmicolar asthaline, and saline nebulization with 02. Treatment with cetrizine 2.5mg BD for cold and watery nasal discharge with severe dry cough is already in place. Beclase 2 puffs BD is being prescribed for severe cough and cold, with TID (twice a day).\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that it's been over 15 days and the symptoms haven't improved is a significant concern.  We need to consider possible causes and potential progression.  It's crucial to remember that asthma can be complex and often requires a multi-faceted approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "<SOLUTION>\n",
      "It's difficult to give a precise timeline for resolution without a full clinical evaluation. However, based on the information provided, here’s a breakdown of possible scenarios and what to assess:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Possible Progression & Likely Factors:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Asthma Control:** The current treatment regimen (Cetrizine and Beclase) is a good starting point for managing his asthma.  However, if the asthma control isn't consistently maintained, the symptoms could worsen.\n",
      "* **Cold Severity:** The cold symptoms (dark yellow discharge, dry cough) suggest a potentially more severe cold than usual.  The cetrizine may be useful, but the underlying asthma triggers the cough.\n",
      "* **Beclase Effect:** Beclase, being a corticosteroid, can help reduce inflammation.  However, prolonged use can have potential side effects, and it’s essential to monitor for any adverse reactions.\n",
      "* **Allergic Asthma:** The persistent nature of the allergic asthma and the response to treatment – the improvement with saline and 02 – indicates that the immune system needs to be managed.\n",
      "* **Underlying Cause:**  While not immediately apparent, it’s important to consider that the recurrence of symptoms could indicate an underlying cause – such as infection, food allergies, or other environmental triggers.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Possible Timeframes – Highly Variable:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Short-Term (within 1-2 weeks):** It’s *possible* to see some improvement with continued consistent use of Cetrizine and saline, and if the asthma control is stable.  The mucociliary clearance (the natural defense against respiratory infections) could be improving.\n",
      "* **Moderate (2-4 weeks):**  With continued aggressive management of asthma and a careful assessment of the cold symptoms, a noticeable improvement may emerge. \n",
      "* **Longer-Term (4-8 weeks or more):**  If the underlying asthma isn't adequately controlled, or if the cold symptoms persist and worsen, it may take longer to see a significant response.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Detailed Assessment:**  A thorough reassessment is crucial.  This should include:\n",
      "    * **Peak Flow Monitoring:**  To assess asthma control.\n",
      "    * **Detailed History:**  Asking about recent infections, exposure to allergens, diet, and other potential triggers.\n",
      "    * **Physical Examination:**  To assess for signs of respiratory distress.\n",
      "    * **Allergy Testing:**  To rule out allergic triggers.\n",
      "2. **Asthma Action Plan:** Develop a comprehensive asthma action plan with the physician, including medication adjustments, triggers to avoid, and sick day rules.\n",
      "3. **Monitor for Deterioration:**  Closely monitor for worsening symptoms such as increased wheezing, shortness of breath, or chest tightness.\n",

      "Hi, Synovial cysts are not believed to be a significant contributor to the symptom of low back pain and should not be aggressively managed unless they are known to take up gadolinium contrast dye in which case surgical removal of the cyst with pathological examination may be warranted.  If the PET scan does not show any increased activity in the hip region on the right then, it is not likely to be due to any type of metastatic spread of the melanoma.  Conservative exercise and PT regimens are your best options to treat the pain along with OTC analgesic relief such as ibuprofen or Tylenol. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. \n",

      "This patient presents with a complex and concerning pattern of lower back and hip pain, exacerbated by specific activities (morning, night, standing, sitting), alongside a significant history of a Clark's Level 4 melanoma and recent surgical removal. The MRI findings of a synovial cyst at L4-L5, coupled with the PET scan showing SUV uptake in the right jugular lymph node, strongly suggests an advanced metastatic melanoma within the right thigh, and a potential involvement of the lymphatic system. Given the patient's history and current findings, a thorough investigation is critical to determine the extent and relevance of this metastasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "<SOLUTION>\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommended Approach & Next Steps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Detailed History & Physical Exam:** A more in-depth history is crucial. This should include:\n",
      "    * **Pain Characteristics:**  Refine the pain description – is it sharp, dull, aching?  What triggers it, and does it respond to any treatments (e.g., ice, heat)?\n",
      "    * **Associated Symptoms:**  Any systemic symptoms (fever, chills, weight loss, fatigue, nausea, vomiting)?\n",
      "    * **Radiation History:**  Any recent radiation therapy, even if it was for a different condition?\n",
      "    * **Medication Review:**  Complete medication list, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.\n",
      "    * **Family History:** Assess for family history of melanoma or other cancers.\n",
      "    * **Physical Exam:**  Detailed assessment of the right thigh, hip region, and surrounding areas for tenderness, swelling, and signs of infection.  Lymph node examination, including palpation of the inguinal and periginal lymphatic nodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Lymph Node Biopsy:** This is the **priority**. A definitive diagnosis requires a lymph node biopsy.  Ideally, this would be performed *immediately*, with consideration for a needle biopsy (if feasible) if there's an immediate suspicion of metastasis.  The biopsy should be performed with the patient's informed consent. The biopsy should be sent to a pathology lab immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Metastatic Lymph Node Sampling (MLS):**  If the biopsy is indeterminate (e.g., contains atypical lymphocytes), consider Performing a minimally invasive metastatic lymph node sampling (MLS) to obtain a more comprehensive sample with potentially more representative metastatic cells. This can be performed via VATS (virtual arthrodesis) or through a specialized surgical approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Imaging Updates:**  Repeat MRI of the right thigh and pelvis to monitor for any changes.  Consider a CT with IV contrast to further assess the extent of the lymph nodes and regional lymphatics.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Molecular Testing (Consideration):** Given the surgical removal and the recent melanoma diagnosis, consider molecular testing of the lymph node biopsies. This can identify specific mutations or biomarkers associated with metastasis and potentially guide treatment decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Clinical Trials:** Explore potential clinical trials investigating novel therapies for metastatic melanoma.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Systemic Therapy:**  The patient will likely require systemic therapy, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapies, depending on the stage and characteristics of the metastasis.  The choice of therapy will be individualized based on the patient's overall health and the specific characteristics of the tumor.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Pain Management:**  Address the patient's chronic pain with appropriate analgesics and non-pharmacological approaches (e.g., physical therapy, massage).\n",

      "\n",
      "Given the patient’s diagnosis of Sanflippo Sydrome MPS III – a condition characterized by severe joint issues and mobility limitations – and the impending terminal prognosis, exploring anti-inflammatory medication options is a crucial and complex consideration. However, it’s vital to emphasize that **there is no guaranteed treatment that can halt or reverse the progression of this condition.** Management focuses on minimizing suffering, improving quality of life, and addressing specific symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "<SOLUTION>\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, there is no single anti-inflammatory medication that definitively cures Sanflippo MPS III. However, several options are being investigated and implemented, often in combination, with careful monitoring and adjustments based on individual patient response and tolerance. Here’s a breakdown of potential approaches and considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs):** NSAIDs (like ibuprofen, naproxen) can help manage pain and inflammation. *However*, their efficacy is limited in Sanflippo MPS III, and long-term use carries potential risks, including gastrointestinal issues, kidney problems, and cardiovascular effects. Careful monitoring is essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Corticosteroids:** Corticosteroids (prednisone, dexamethasone) are potent anti-inflammatory agents.  They are frequently used to manage severe inflammation. However, their use is generally reserved for situations where other treatments have failed, and potential risks—including osteoporosis, increased risk of infections, and adrenal suppression—must be carefully weighed.  They are also rarely effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biologics:** This is the most promising area of research currently.  Several biologics, including TNF inhibitors (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab), IL-17 inhibitors (e.g., secukinumab, ixekizumab), and JAK inhibitors (e.g., tofacitinib, baricitinib), have shown some benefit in slowing disease progression and alleviating symptoms in some patients with Sanflippo MPS III. *These medications are expensive and require careful consideration of potential side effects.*\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Other Potential Approaches:**  Research is ongoing into other therapies, including:\n",
      "    *   **Targeted therapies:**  Drugs that specifically target pathways involved in inflammation.\n",
      "    *   **Immunomodulatory therapies:**  Strategies to dampen the immune system's aberrant response.\n",
      "    *   **Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation:**  Continued participation in physical therapy and mobility training is critical regardless of medication use.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Monitoring and Management:**  Close monitoring of pain levels, joint function, cardiovascular health, and overall well-being is vital.  Regular assessments of medication side effects and adjustments to the treatment plan are necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Individualized Treatment:**  The best approach is almost always individualized.  The physician will likely start with a conservative approach and monitor response closely.\n",
      "*   **Quality of Life:**  The goal is to maximize quality of life, even in the face of a terminal diagnosis.  Focusing on symptom management, maintaining function, and providing comfort are paramount.\n",
      "*  **Clinical Trials:** Exploring potential clinical trials or research opportunities might offer access to novel therapies.\n",

      "This sounds like a concerning situation. A lump on the back, combined with pain in the back and stomach, particularly worsened by activities like standing and walking, warrants attention. It’s important to rule out serious underlying causes. Let’s break down potential causes and what to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "<SOLUTION>\n",
      "Given the symptoms – a lump, back pain, stomach pain, worsened by activity – it’s crucial to schedule an appointment with a physician as soon as possible.  Here's a breakdown of potential causes and a suggested plan:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Possible Causes:**\n",
      "   * **Lymph Node Mass:** A palpable lump could be a lymph node, and it’s often a benign (non-cancerous) lymph node.\n",
      "   * **Musculoskeletal Issues:**  Muscle strain, ligament sprains, or even a more serious condition like a facet joint issue (affecting the back) could be contributing.\n",
      "   * **Tumor (Less Likely, but Important to Consider):** While less common, a tumor in the back could present with pain and lump-like symptoms.\n",
      "   * **Less Common Causes:**  Rarely, the lump could be related to an infection or other systemic conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Recommended Actions:**\n",
      "   * **Consult a Physician:**  The *most important* first step is to see a doctor – ideally a general practitioner or a specialist like a rheumatologist, neurologist, or oncologist depending on the suspected cause.\n",
      "   * **Physical Examination:** The doctor will perform a thorough physical exam, including palpation (feeling the lump) and assessing the range of motion.\n",
      "   * **Imaging Tests (Likely Needed):**  Based on the physical exam and initial assessment, imaging tests are likely necessary to determine the nature of the lump. These may include:\n",
      "      * **Ultrasound:** Can be useful for visualizing soft tissues.\n",
      "      * **X-ray:**  May be used to rule out bony abnormalities.\n",
      "      * **CT Scan:** Provides more detailed images of the bones and surrounding tissues.\n",
      "      * **MRI:** Provides the most detailed images, including soft tissues.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **While Waiting for an Appointment:**\n",
      "   * **Rest:** Avoid activities that worsen the pain.\n",
      "   * **Ice/Heat:** Applying ice for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day, can help reduce inflammation.  Warm compresses may help with muscle stiffness.\n",
      "   * **Pain Relief:** Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) can help manage pain. (Consult with a doctor or pharmacist before taking any medication, especially if you have other medical conditions).\n",

      "\n",
      "<SOLUTION>\n",
      "First, let’s validate your feelings. It’s completely normal to feel hopeless and discouraged when you feel like you've \"spoiled your life.\" Many people experience similar thoughts and struggles, especially during periods of transition and uncertainty. The fact that you’re recognizing this and actively seeking guidance is a huge first step.\n",

      "2. **Explore Your Interests – Even Small Ones:**  You mentioned you don’t know what you’ll *do* in life, and that’s okay.  Start exploring things that might spark even a tiny bit of interest. This doesn’t need to be anything grand; it could be:\n",
      "   * **Hobbies:**  What are you naturally drawn to?  Even just doodling, reading, or collecting something small can be a starting point.\n",
      "   * **Online Resources:** Websites like Coursera, Khan Academy, or YouTube offer free courses and tutorials on a huge range of subjects – from coding to cooking to history.\n",
      "   * **Volunteer:**  Helping others can be incredibly rewarding and provide a sense of purpose.  Even a small commitment (volunteering at an animal shelter, a food bank, or a local community garden) can be a good start.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Challenge Your Social Anxiety:** It's understandable that you’re hesitant to interact with others, especially given your introverted nature.  Start small:\n",
      "   * **Set Realistic Goals:** Instead of aiming to have deep, meaningful conversations, start with simple interactions – a smile, a nod, asking someone how their day is going.\n",
      "   * **Focus on Small Interactions:**  Even a brief, polite interaction can be a victory.  Start with people you already feel somewhat comfortable with – a cashier at the grocery store, a neighbor.\n",
      "   * **Gradual Exposure:**  The key is to gradually increase your comfort level.  Don't force yourself to be the life of the party.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Focus on Building Self-Esteem:** You mentioned your family is supportive, which is wonderful.  However, often, feelings of inadequacy stem from our own internal narratives.  \n",
      "   * **Identify Your Strengths:** Make a list of things you’re good at – even small things.\n",

      "**1. Immediate Possibilities & Relatively Common:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar):** This is the most likely immediate concern. Even with good blood sugar readings, fluctuations can occur, especially with emotional stress.  Her shaking could be a physical response to low blood sugar, a symptom of the body struggling to maintain stable glucose levels.\n",
      "*   **Anxiety/Stress:**  Her increased emotional sensitivity and shaking are strong indicators of potential anxiety.  Stress, even seemingly minor stressors, can disrupt the body’s hormonal balance and affect motor function.\n",

      "Hi there. For best results of course, any dermatologist worth his salt would require a visual, so feel free to upload a clear digital photograph on this site using the upload data icon. Alternatively & if privacy desired, do directly get in touch with moist using the ask-a-doctor premium portal & ask for a specific doctor. Off the cuff, given your history & clinical description, the rash appears to be Herpes Zoster. If so, it is a reactivation of latent Varicella (chicken pox) that you must have had at some point in the past. The worst is over. No point in systemic antivirals as 48-72 hrs has already elapsed. Treat all the symptoms e.g. pain, burning; apply a 5% acyclovir cream locally 3-5 times /day till all lesions scabbed over. The lesions will all scab & fall off. Try not to pinch or price them off to avoid scarring. Take adequate rest, eat good food & relax. Stressors that cause a depression in immunity frequently predispose to its occurrence.

      "Okay, this sounds incredibly distressing. Given the combination of symptoms – a burning boil-like rash, stiffness, pain, anxiety, and a history of phoresis, it’s crucial to approach this systematically. Let’s break down potential causes and next steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "<SOLUTION>\n",
      "\n",
      "**Possible Causes - This is NOT a diagnosis, just possibilities:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Localized Vasculitis:** This is a common possibility, especially given the burning, itchy rash and the described joint pain. Vasculitis involves inflammation of the blood vessels, and it can present as a variety of rashes, sometimes resembling boils. The anxiety you're experiencing could be contributing to this. It's possible a reaction to the tomatoes is triggering it.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Drug Reaction:** Could the tomatoes have triggered a reaction? Some individuals are sensitive to foods and can experience rashes or other symptoms as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Autoimmune Condition:** Your history of phoresis (a genetic autoimmune disorder) increases the likelihood of an underlying autoimmune process affecting the skin and potentially the nervous system. This could be contributing to the inflammation and the rash's appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Skin Infection (Bacterial/Fungal):**  The burning rash and potential for scab formation are suggestive of a bacterial or fungal infection, especially considering the possible inflammation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Stress-Related Dermatitis:** The anxiety you’ve mentioned is a significant factor.  Stress can trigger or worsen skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis, which can manifest as rashes and inflammation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations - Urgent Action Needed:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **See a Doctor IMMEDIATELY:**  Given the severity of the rash, the pain, and your history of phoresis, you need to see a dermatologist *immediately*. Don’t delay. A vascular specialist would be ideal, but a dermatologist can assess the rash and help determine the cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Detailed History:** Be prepared to answer questions about:\n",
      "    *   **Specific Tomatoes:**  What variety and quantity of tomatoes?  When did you start eating them?\n",
      "    *   **Anxiety Levels:** How severe is your anxiety?  What specifically is triggering it?\n",
      "    *   **Other Symptoms:** Are you experiencing any fever, chills, swelling, redness, pus, or any other unusual symptoms?\n",
      "    *   **Medications:** Are you taking any medications (prescription or over-the-counter)?\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Diagnostic Tests:** The doctor will likely order tests, such as:\n",
      "    *   **Skin Biopsy:** To examine the rash in detail and rule out other conditions.\n",
      "    *   **Blood Tests:** To check for inflammation, autoimmune markers, and infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Stress Management:**  While waiting for the doctor, focus on stress reduction techniques: deep breathing, meditation, gentle exercise, and talking to a therapist.\n",

      "I am 29 years old, weighing 78 kg. Its been 3 years since I had my first born and now wish to plan for a second child. Ive suffered from Tuberculoma of the brain in the past and its been 1 year since Ive complete treatment. Is it too early to plan for another child. I fear becuase of 1. My curent weight and how it will affect the foetus 2. The intesnse treatment I was on and if theres any residue in my body that might affect the foetus.Any advice/suggestions/help will be much appreciated.Thanks, Doll \n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Hi, Since it's been almost a year since you have been treated, the past tuberculous will not affect your pregnancy. Your weight at 78 kg is more, but I would like to know your height as well. Excess weight prior to pregnancy can cause problems, such as gestational diabetes, hypertension in pregnancy. There is also increased risk of miscarriage and fetal problems. The baby may be large which can cause more chances of cesarean, and also bleeding after birth. So, depending on your BMI calculated with weight/(Height)2, I would advise weight loss before embarking on the pregnancy. Hope this helps. Regards. \n",

      "Okay, this is a very important and sensitive situation. Let’s break down your concerns and discuss a thoughtful approach to planning for a potential second child.  It’s absolutely not too early to start thinking about this, but it *does* require careful consideration and consultation with medical professionals.\n",
      "\n",
      "<SOLUTION>\n",
      "\n",
      "**Here's a breakdown of my thoughts and recommendations, addressing your specific concerns:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Your Health History and Current State:**\n",
      "   * **Tuberculoma of the Brain:**  You've had this diagnosed a year ago.  Crucially, it’s important to understand the *type* of treatment you received (likely immunosuppressive medications) and its residual effects.  The recovery from this treatment is key.  It’s vital to discuss *exactly* what medications you were on, their dosages, and how long they were administered.  Some medications have significant long-term effects on the mother and fetus.\n",
      "   * **Weight:** Your current weight of 78 kg (approximately 170 lbs) is a significant factor.  It's important to monitor this carefully, as significant weight gain after pregnancy can be a complication.  A healthy BMI is vital for both your overall health and the benefit for the baby.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Potential Risks to the Fetus:**\n",
      "   * **Immunosuppression:**  The medications you received for the Tuberculoma had immunosuppressive effects. These medications can potentially compromise the body’s ability to properly support fetal development.\n",
      "   * **Residual Medication:**  It's possible that small amounts of the medications you were on might still be circulating in your system, although this is a less likely concern with long-term treatment.  This is why ongoing monitoring and communication with your doctor are critical.\n",
      "   * **Increased Risk Factors:**  As a woman with a history of Tuberculoma, you have a higher risk of certain complications during pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and postpartum hemorrhage.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Advice & Suggestions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   * **Second Opinion with a Specialist:**  I *strongly* recommend consulting with a Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialist (a doctor specializing in pregnancy and fetal health). They can provide a more detailed assessment of your individual risks and the best course of action.\n",
      "   * **Comprehensive Medical Evaluation:** Schedule a thorough evaluation, including:\n",
      "      * **Blood Tests:**  Specifically, tests to assess your immune system, assess for any lingering effects of your medication, and check levels of hormones important for fetal development.\n",
      "      * **Urine Tests:** To look for any residual medication metabolites.\n",
      "      * **Imaging (if indicated):**  Depending on your doctor's assessment, imaging tests (like ultrasound) might be recommended to monitor the baby's growth and development.\n",
      "   * **Discuss Fertility Options:**  While it's a sensitive topic, consider discussing with your doctor if fertility preservation options (like egg freezing) might be a possibility down the road, *after* you've established a stable pregnancy plan.\n",
      "   * **Lifestyle Modifications:**  Maintain a healthy lifestyle – a balanced diet, regular exercise (as approved by your doctor), and adequate rest – to support your overall health and the baby’s development.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Important Note on Waiting Period:** Most healthcare providers recommend a waiting period (typically 6-12 weeks) after delivery before attempting to conceive again. This allows time for the body to recover and for any potential complications to be identified and addressed.\n",

      "This sounds concerning, and it's good you’re taking it seriously. The described sensation – a lump near the collarbone, feeling around it when your arms are elevated, and the difficulty in feeling it when your arms are down – could potentially be related to several things. However, it's crucial to understand that I am an AI and cannot provide a diagnosis.  A proper diagnosis requires a medical professional. Here's a breakdown of potential causes, ranging from more common to less so, and what you should consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Possible Causes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Musculoskeletal Issues:** This is the most likely initial consideration. The feeling around the collarbone could be due to:\n",
      "   * **Muscle Strain/Tension:**  Overuse of the muscles in that area could be causing tightness and a sensation of a lump.  This is particularly likely if you’ve recently increased your activity levels.\n",
      "   * **Ligament Issues:**  Minor ligament sprains or imbalances in the surrounding tissues could contribute to a feeling of discomfort or pressure.\n",
      "   * **Facet Joint Dysfunction:** The facet joints are small joints in your spine that allow for movement.  Problems with these joints can sometimes manifest as localized pain and sensitivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Skin Conditions:**\n",
      "   * **Fibroma:** These are benign (non-cancerous) growths of connective tissue. They can range in size and feel like a lump, and they can sometimes be painless, especially early on.\n",
      "   * **Lipoma:**  A lipoma is a fat tumor.  While they can often be felt, they can sometimes be felt as a small lump.\n",
      "   * **Skin Tags:**  Common, small, benign growths often found in areas where skin rubs together.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Other Possibilities (Less Likely, but Require Investigation):**\n",
      "   * **Tumor:**  While it's less likely given the description (thin, skinny, not radiating), a tumor is a possibility.  However, the difficulty in feeling it when your arms are down is unusual.\n",
      "   * **Epidermoid Cyst:**  These can be small, often painless, and may feel like a lump under the skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Nerve Involvement:**  Although you state you've had no previous lymph node feelings, it’s still possible a nerve is being irritated.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What You Should Do:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **See a Doctor (Important!)**:  Given the potential seriousness, *schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or a dermatologist*. They can perform a physical examination, which may include:\n",
      "   * **Palpation:** Gently feeling the area around the collarbone.\n",
      "   * **Medical History Review:**  Discussing your symptoms in detail and asking about any other relevant medical conditions.\n",
      "   * **Imaging Studies (Possibly):**  Depending on your doctor's assessment, they may order imaging tests like an ultrasound or MRI to help determine the cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Avoid Self-Treating:**  Don't try to diagnose yourself or treat the lump yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Document Your Symptoms:** Keep a record of when the sensation occurs (e.g., after exercise, when you are stressed, etc.).\n",

      "**Understanding Your Case**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **HBeAB+VE, HBeAG-VE:** These indicate Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBeAB) and Hepatitis B Ag-ve respectively, suggesting a current infection or recent infection.\n",
      "*   **Total Bilirium 0.5 mg/dL:**  This is a significantly low bilirubin level, which is concerning.\n",
      "*   **C Bilirium 0.10 mg/dL:** This also indicates low bilirubin, reinforcing the concern about the liver’s ability to process bilirubin.\n",
      "*   **ALT 19.0 IU/mL & AST 23.5 IU/mL:** These are elevated liver enzymes, pointing to potential liver damage or inflammation.\n",
      "*   **Total Protein 7.3 g/dL & Albumin 4.8 g/dL:** These indicate a degree of protein loss, suggesting potential damage to the liver's proteins.\n",
      "*   **HBV DNA Viral Copies/mL Plasma 750:** This indicates a high viral load, which is a crucial piece of information.  Higher viral loads usually signify a more active infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Stage of Disease & Condition of the Liver**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on these findings, you are likely experiencing an **active Hepatitis B infection** or a severe, likely chronic, Hepatitis B infection. The elevated ALT and AST, along with the low bilirubin, combined with the high HBV DNA, strongly suggest that liver damage is occurring.  It’s important to note that liver disease can progress over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Should You Start Medical Treatment?**\n",

      "**This is a critical question that requires a thorough evaluation by a qualified healthcare professional.**  As of now, without a full clinical evaluation, I cannot determine if treatment is necessary. However, based on the severity of your symptoms and laboratory results, it’s wise to consider further investigation and potentially treatment.\n",

      "**Potential Treatment Options (Discuss with your doctor):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Antiviral Medications:**  HBV treatments are available.  Nucleoside/Nucleotide analogs (e.g., Tenofovir, Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate) are the most common and effective.  These help reduce viral replication.\n",
      "*   **Interferon Therapy:** May be used in some cases, particularly if the viral load is very high.\n",
      "*   **Monitoring:** Regular blood tests (including ALT, AST, bilirubin, HBV DNA, albumin, and liver enzyme levels) will be essential to monitor your progress and adjust treatment as needed.\n",

      "**Estimated Timeline for Treatment**\n",

      "I am 69 years, Male, having type 2 since 2000. Taking Glynase XL10 2 times before breakfast and dinner, glucomet 1 gm 2 times, after breafast and dinner.Is it ok. FAsting 140/160, PPBS 190/220 like that. Fasting BS flactuating-120/160. Please advise. \n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Hi, Thanks for your question. At present, you are on optimal dose of Flonase and Glycogen. With this your blood sugar levels are out of acceptable range. Considering absence of heart or kidney disease in you target blood sugar levels for you arresting below 130 and Postprandial below 180. It is advisable to do - HbA1c which gives fair idea about blood sugar control over last 3 to 4 months. - Kidney function test. - Urinary albumin creatinine ratio. - Lipid Profile. - Liver function test. - Thyroid function test. - ECG and if required 2DEcho. For blood sugar control I will advise addition of Foliose with lunch and dinner. Frequent monitoring of blood sugar levels. Depending upon blood sugar levels and HbA1c level future changes in medications can be done. All this need to be discussed with your doctor. Hope this helps you, if so do vote. \n",

      "Okay, let’s analyze this situation. It’s crucial to understand that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for informational purposes only and shouldn’t replace a consultation with a qualified healthcare professional.  The following assessment is based on the provided information and needs to be discussed with your doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "<SOLUTION>\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s a breakdown of your situation and possible considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Medical History & Diabetes:** You’ve been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes since 2000. This is a significant factor to consider – medication adjustments are generally needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Glynase XL10 & Glucomet:** Taking Glynase XL10 and Glucomet twice before breakfast and dinner *could* be contributing to elevated blood sugar levels. However, it's critical to understand how these medications are interacting with each other.  Both medications have effects on glucose control. The timing is important – taking them together, especially before meals, can influence how your body responds.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Blood Glucose Measurements:**\n",
      "   *   **Fasting Blood Glucose (140/160):** This is a fasting glucose level of 140 mg/dL and 160 mg/dL.  It suggests you have elevated glucose levels *after* fasting.\n",
      "   *   **PPBS (190/220):** This is a blood pressure reading. While not directly related to blood glucose, it's important because hypertension can worsen insulin resistance and glucose control.\n",
      "   *   **Fasting Blood Glucose Fluctuation (120/160):** This fluctuation is a key point.  A fluctuating glucose level suggests that your body isn't efficiently responding to the medication or food intake. This could be a sign of impaired glucose tolerance or insulin resistance. This is important to address, as it indicates potential problems with your body's ability to process glucose.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Potential Concerns & Recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   *   **Medication Interactions:** Glynase XL10 and Glucomet *could* be interacting with each other, potentially worsening your blood glucose levels.  Research the specific interactions between these medications.\n",
      "   *   **Dietary Factors:** The combination of medication and your elevated glucose levels could be contributing to your high fasting blood glucose.\n",
      "   *   **Possible Underlying Issues:** The fluctuation in fasting glucose and blood pressure might be related to insulin resistance or impaired glucose control.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Recommended Action:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   *   **Consult Your Doctor:** This is absolutely essential. Discuss these findings with your doctor, who can assess your overall health, review your medications, perform further testing, and determine the best course of action.\n",
      "   *   **Repeat Blood Glucose Testing:** Your doctor may recommend more frequent blood glucose monitoring to better understand your responses to the medication and diet.\n",
      "   * **Consider a Comprehensive Glucose Profile:**  Your doctor might order a comprehensive glucose profile to assess your insulin sensitivity, pancreatic function, and overall metabolic health.\n",
      "   * **Lifestyle Modifications:**  In addition to medication, your doctor may suggest lifestyle changes like diet, exercise, and stress management.\n",

      "My adult daughter broke two of her toes, one was a complete break. This occurred 4 weeks ago and she is still experiencing significant pain (not constant but enough to make us wonder if she is healing properly). She has no insurance and had the bad toe set at hospital emergency room. Should we see about trying to get to an orthopedic doctor and see if she may need additional treatment (this will have to be paid out of our pockets and we do not have a lot of money). Thanks, YYYY@YYYY \n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Welcome to Chat Doctor After going through your query I concluded that your daughter got fracture of her toe nearly one month back. By now it is likely that her toes must have united. Now she needs exercises of toe and analgesic for pain relief. Vitamin B, vitamin C and calcium supplements will promote healing. You can take analgesic such as ibuprofen. You can take vitamin B-complex and C to promote healing. Furthermore, you can discuss with your Doctor about it. Hope your query get answered. If you have any further questions then don't hesitate to writing to us. I will be happy to help you. You can also write to me directly on below link \n",

      "Okay, let's break down this situation. This is a serious concern and requires careful consideration. Here’s my thought process and potential next steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Understanding the Situation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Severe Injury:** Two complete toe breaks are a significant injury requiring immediate attention. A complete break means the bone is shattered and needs specialized stabilization.\n",
      "*   **Ongoing Pain:** The persistent pain is a crucial indicator of a potential problem. It suggests the healing process isn’t progressing as expected, potentially due to complications or insufficient tissue repair.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Insurance:** This is a significant obstacle. Without insurance, the cost of orthopedic care can be prohibitive.\n",
      "*   **Emergency Room Visit:** The fact that the injury occurred in the ER suggests a potentially complex situation requiring swift intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Potential Concerns & Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Soft Tissue Damage:**  A complete fracture can lead to soft tissue damage (ligaments, tendons, nerves) around the toe. These tissues can heal very slowly and can restrict function.\n",
      "*   **Infection:**  Open wounds, especially with a fracture, are at higher risk of infection. This needs to be ruled out.\n",
      "*   **Nonunion:** The toes may not heal properly – this is a common complication after a fracture.\n",
      "*   **Chronic Pain:** Prolonged pain can indicate an underlying problem that needs to be addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Recommendations & Next Steps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "I strongly recommend pursuing the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Contact an Orthopedic Specialist:** Immediately call a reputable orthopedic surgeon or hand surgeon. Explain the situation – the severity of the injuries, the ongoing pain, and your financial constraints. They can assess the situation, determine the best course of action, and advise on treatment options.\n",
      "*   **Explore Financial Assistance:** Research options for financial assistance.  This could include:\n",
      "    *   Hospital financial assistance programs.\n",
      "    *   Local charities and community organizations.\n",
      "    *   Crowdfunding (if appropriate).\n",
      "    *   Negotiate payment plans with the hospital.\n",
      "*   **Consider a Second Opinion:** If the initial orthopedic consultation is unclear, seek a second opinion from another specialist.\n",
      "*   **Monitor the Situation Closely:**  Keep a detailed record of the pain levels, any changes in swelling, and any movement or function limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4.  Why Seeing an Orthopedist is Crucial:**\n",
      "\n",
      "An orthopedic specialist is best equipped to diagnose the specific issues causing the pain, determine the appropriate treatment plan (which could involve casting, bracing, physical therapy, or surgery), and manage any complications.\n",

The combination of stomach pain, nausea, throat discomfort, belching, sweating, funny noises, dry mouth, sour taste, gas, and increased hunger strongly suggests a digestive issue, potentially with a combination of things. Here’s a breakdown of possibilities, ranging from more common to less common:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Gastritis:** Inflammation of the stomach lining. This can cause pain, nausea, vomiting, and bloating.\n",
      "*   **Gastroparesis:** Delayed stomach emptying.  This can lead to nausea, vomiting, bloating, and a feeling of fullness.\n",
      "*   **Erosive Esophagitis:** Damage to the esophagus from acid reflux or other irritants. This can cause pain, difficulty swallowing, and regurgitation.\n",
      "*   **Constipation:** A buildup of stool in the digestive tract can cause pain, bloating, gas, and nausea.\n",
      "*   **Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO):** An excessive amount of bacteria in the small intestine can interfere with digestion and lead to bloating, gas, and diarrhea.\n",
      "*   **Pancreatitis:** Inflammation of the pancreas, which can cause severe upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  While less likely given the other symptoms, it's important to consider.\n",
      "*   **Food Intolerance/Allergy:**  A reaction to a food you consume can cause discomfort, bloating, gas, and other symptoms.\n",
      "*   **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):** While often associated with constipation, IBS can also present with nausea, bloating, and pain.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  **See a Doctor:**  Schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or a gastroenterologist as soon as possible. They can perform a physical exam, ask detailed questions about your symptoms, and order tests to help determine the cause.\n",
      "2.  **Diagnostic Tests:**  Your doctor may order tests such as:\n",
      "    *   **Endoscopy:** To visualize the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.\n",
      "    *   **Breath test (Stool Phenylalanine or Lactulose):** To check for SIBO.\n",

      "<start_working_out>\n",
      "Okay, let's break down this situation. It sounds like your mum’s symptoms warrant a deeper investigation beyond just the initial diagnosis and treatment. The fact that the X-ray was normal but the nerve compression persists, coupled with the increased pain after physiotherapy sessions, suggests a more complex issue.  Here’s a working out of potential causes and a suggested approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "<SOLUTION>\n",
      "1.  **Ruling out other possibilities:** The fact that the X-ray is negative doesn’t rule out compression.  Sometimes, subtle nerve compression can be missed by a simple X-ray.  We need to consider other potential causes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Possible Conditions to Consider:**\n",
      "    *   **Sciatica with Referred Pain:** The compression of the lumbosacral nerve could be referred pain from the lower back, causing the sensation of pressure and pain in the back. This is a common scenario.\n",
      "    *   **Facet Joint Dysfunction:** The facet joints in the spine can become irritated or inflamed, leading to pain and referred sensations.\n",
      "    *   **Spinal Stenosis (Mild):**  Although less likely with ossification of cartilage, mild spinal stenosis can present with pain and nerve involvement.\n",
      "    *   **Peripheral Neuropathy:** While less probable without any red flags, peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage) could contribute to changes in sensation and pain.\n",
      "    *   **Muscle Tension/Spasms:**  Chronic muscle tension in the back muscles could be causing referred pain.\n",
      "    *   **Psychogenic Pain:** The psychological impact of the pain, coupled with the physical issue, needs to be considered.  It's possible the pain is partly a result of her anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Why Physiotherapy is Contributing to Increased Pain:** Physiotherapy's approach, focusing on movement and stretching, may actually be exacerbating the problem. It could be putting more strain on the already compromised nerve.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Vit D Level:** A 4-hour Vitamin D level is also concerning and doesn’t necessarily indicate a problem. It's potentially a result of her not getting enough sunlight, or a dietary deficiency, which can contribute to conditions like inflammation and nerve sensitivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Next Steps – A Multi-faceted Approach:**\n",
      "    *   **Further Imaging (Consideration):**  While she's anxious, a *slightly* more detailed imaging might be beneficial. An MRI with contrast *could* help visualize the nerve structures and identify any narrowing or inflammation. However, given her claustrophobia, this is a sensitive area.  A *very* low dose of ultrasound might also be considered.\n",
      "    *   **Comprehensive Assessment by a Specialist:**  Crucially, she needs to see a **neurologist** or **orthopedic specialist** with expertise in nerve compression. They can perform a thorough neurological exam, and potentially order other tests like:\n",
      "        *   **Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS):** To assess nerve function.\n",
      "        *   **EMG (Electromyography):** To evaluate muscle function.\n",
      "        *   **Spinal Conduction Study:** To assess nerve impulse conduction.\n",
      "        *   **Facet Joint Injection:**  This could be considered to evaluate for inflammation or impingement.\n",
      "    *   **Alternative Therapies – Explore Carefully:**  Given her claustrophobia, she needs to discuss alternative therapies with her doctor.  Options like acupuncture (with a qualified practitioner) or gentle massage *might* be helpful, but they need to be carefully implemented and monitored.  It’s important to ensure these aren’t inadvertently worsening the pain.\n",

      "Hi, this is a very concerning and complex situation. Empty sella syndrome (ESS) is a rare condition where the sella turcada, a small cavity in the back of the skull, doesn’t fully close after surgery. It can lead to significant pressure in the sinuses, causing a variety of symptoms, including headaches, facial pain, nasal congestion, and vision problems. The recent MRI scan is a crucial first step, but it’s important to understand that the exact cause and progression of ESS can vary significantly between individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "<SOLUTION>\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, there’s no definitive cure for ESS, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. Medications can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain.  Lifestyle modifications, such as avoiding triggers (like caffeine or strong odors), managing stress, and utilizing saline nasal rinses, can be beneficial.  Surgery is an option, but it's often considered a last resort when other treatments haven’t been effective.\n",

      "Regarding the possibility of children with ESS, it’s extremely rare, and the diagnosis is very challenging. ESS is typically diagnosed in adults. While there's ongoing research exploring potential therapeutic targets within the sella turcada itself, there are currently no proven methods for treating or even successfully preventing the condition in children.  The risk of complications for a child with a complex condition like ESS is significant, and the potential benefits are not well-established. Further research is needed before any potential treatments could be considered for children.  It's essential to have a very open and honest discussion with the neurologist about the likelihood of a beneficial response and the potential risks involved. \n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "Hello, There is no medication or surgery to increase the size of the penis. You should not worry about penis size in erection stage. During sexual intercourse initial 3-4 inch portion of the vagina is only sensitive for sexual stimulus and so you may need not worry if penis size is 4.5 inch in an erection.  You can take a healthy and nutritious diet more.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. \n",

      "I understand you're experiencing a significant amount of anxiety and exploring potential solutions for increasing the size of your penis. It's completely natural to be concerned about this, especially with the emotional and physical implications of a major life change. However, I need to be very clear: **I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice or recommendations for medical procedures.**  Providing information about penis enlargement techniques could be misleading and potentially harmful.  Furthermore, there is currently no scientifically proven method to significantly increase penis size. Most claims about such methods are fraudulent or based on ineffective practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "<SOLUTION>\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of what you're experiencing and what options you *should* explore, emphasizing responsible and ethical approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Addressing Underlying Concerns:**  It’s crucial to understand that anxiety and feelings of inadequacy can significantly impact sexual confidence and desire.  If you're experiencing significant emotional distress related to this, consider speaking to a therapist or counselor. They can help you process your feelings and develop coping mechanisms.  A therapist specializing in sexual health can provide a safe and supportive space to discuss these concerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Pelvic Floor Exercises (Kegels):** These exercises strengthen the muscles in your pelvic area, which is vital for erectile function and overall sexual pleasure.  They’re safe and readily accessible.  I recommend searching online for “Kegel exercises” – there are many reputable videos and resources available. Consistency is key.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Lifestyle Factors:** \n",
      "   * **Healthy Diet:** A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains supports overall health and can positively affect hormone levels (although this is a complex topic and not a magic bullet).\n",
      "   * **Regular Exercise:**  Physical activity improves circulation, which can enhance sexual function.\n",
      "   * **Stress Management:** Chronic stress can impact hormone balance.  Techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing can be helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Lubrication:**  Using plenty of lubricant is essential to enhance sensation and comfort during sexual activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Communication with Your Partner:** Open and honest communication with your wife is vital. Discuss your desires and concerns and work together to find ways to enhance your intimacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Potential Medical Considerations (Discuss with a Doctor):**\n",
      "   * **Hormone Testing:**  If you're experiencing issues with erectile function or desire, your doctor may recommend hormone testing (testosterone).  However, it's imperative to understand that hormone levels alone don't guarantee penis enlargement.\n",
      "   * **Surgery (Rarely Desired):**  While penis enlargement surgery is available, it is a significant and complex procedure with potential risks and long-term outcomes. It’s generally reserved for cases where other treatments have failed and your partner is experiencing significant distress.  Discuss the potential risks and benefits thoroughly with a qualified urologist.\n",

      "**1. Neurological & Sensory Symptoms - The Most Concerning:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Hearing Loss, Vision Blurred, Balance Problems, Cloudy Memory, Thoughts:** These are significant neurological symptoms that could point to several possibilities:\n",
      "    *   **Multiple Sclerosis (MS):** This autoimmune disorder affects the brain and spinal cord, leading to these symptoms. It often presents with cognitive difficulties, vision changes, and balance issues.\n",
      "    *   **Stroke:**  Even if subtle, a stroke could be causing these issues.\n",
      "    *   **Brain Tumor:** Although less common, a tumor in the brain could be contributing to these symptoms.\n",
      "    *   **Migraines:**  These symptoms have a strong neurological component and can be quite debilitating.\n",
      "    * **Conversion Disorder/Hypochondriasis:**  The excessive worry and heightened awareness of symptoms could be a contributing factor, leading to the brain struggling to process what's happening.\n",
      "*   **Itchy Scalp, Swollen Feet & Legs, Burning:** This could be a symptom of peripheral neuropathy – damage to nerves in the extremities. It's often associated with diabetes or other conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Mucus in Stool, Constipation/Diarrhea:** These digestive issues can have a significant impact on overall health and contribute to a feeling of unease.\n",

      "I believe I have hair follicle cancer on my lips, nostrils and chin.I was advised to have a skin graft on my upper lip but decided to dig it out myself. Hard cores seem to be rooted deeply in the hair follicles and are very hard and painful to remove. And there is something in there as hard as fingernail which causes regular stabbing nerve pain. This has taken me two years. Are there any different treatments, like, a cream? \n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Hi, Thanks for writing in. If your symptoms are present for more than two years with no signs of aggressiveness and spreading then it is unlikely to be a cancer. There are few conditions involving hair follicles and these give rise to la broad group of neoplasms called skin adnexal tumors. Hair follicle tumors can be benign or malignant growths. It is important to consult a dermatologist and first confirm your condition. If a malignancy is suspected then more testing like a FNAC or biopsy might be indicated. Treatment depends on the type of cells found and any infection if present. Do not remove scabs with fingernails. Please do not worry. \n",

      "This scenario presents a very serious and concerning medical situation. The symptoms – hair follicle cancer, deep-rooted hard cores, persistent stabbing nerve pain, and a two-year history – are profoundly alarming and demand immediate and thorough investigation. The fact that you've self-extracted a skin graft and are experiencing such intense pain indicates a potentially significant and aggressive lesion. **It is absolutely crucial to seek immediate medical attention.**\n",
      "\n",
      "<SOLUTION>\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complexity of the situation, the treatment approach needs to be multifaceted and involve specialists. Here’s a breakdown of potential investigations and treatments, acknowledging the urgency:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Immediate Diagnostic Imaging:**  A CT scan of the head and neck is *essential* to visualize the lesion, assess its extent, and rule out any spread to other organs.  MRI is also needed to evaluate the surrounding tissues for any involvement of the nerve pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Biopsy:**  A core biopsy is absolutely required to confirm the diagnosis of hair follicle cancer. This involves removing a small sample of the lesion for histological examination under a microscope. This is critical to determine the type of cancer and guide treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Targeted Therapy (Based on Biopsy Results):**  Hair follicle cancer often responds to targeted therapies.  The biopsy results will determine the specific type of cancer (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma) and guide the selection of appropriate targeted therapies. Options could include:\n",
      "    * **Immunotherapy:**  Checkpoint inhibitors (like pembrolizumab or nivolumab) are often effective for head and neck cancers.\n",
      "    * **Herceptin (Trastuzumab):** If the cancer is HER2-positive, this is a potential option.\n",
      "    * **Other targeted agents:** Depending on the specific mutation profile of the cancer, other targeted drugs may be investigated.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Nerve Block and Pain Management:**  The stabbing nerve pain you describe is a significant symptom.  A multidisciplinary approach is necessary.\n",
      "    * **Nerve block:** A temporary nerve block can provide significant pain relief during procedures and imaging.\n",
      "    * **Pain medication:**  Strong pain relievers (opioids) may be required in the short term, but long-term management should focus on non-opioid options.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Surgical Intervention (Potentially):** Depending on the lesion's location, size, and response to initial treatment, surgery might be considered.  However, the presence of hard cores and root involvement makes this more complex and potentially risky. Close monitoring will be critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Supportive Care:**\n",
      "   * **Nutritional Support:** Addressing any nutritional deficiencies that may be contributing to the pain could be important.\n",
      "   * **Psychological Support:** Experiencing chronic pain and a difficult medical situation can be incredibly distressing.  Access to counseling or support groups is vital.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Monitoring:** Regular follow-up appointments with an oncologist are crucial to assess response to treatment and address any potential complications.\n",

The symptoms you’re describing – frequent penile infections, chest/back nerve issues, frequent throat infections, weakness, vision problems, and skin infections – strongly suggest a possible underlying immune compromise, possibly due to HIV. It’s understandable you’re feeling anxious and fearful. Let’s break this down and explore potential next steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "<SOLUTION>\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the history of unprotected sex and the constellation of symptoms, the most likely explanation is an immune system dysfunction, potentially exacerbated by HIV. Here’s a breakdown of what you need to do and what to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Immediate Medical Evaluation - Crucially, Get Tested for HIV:** You’ve already started this, which is excellent.  It is absolutely vital to have a comprehensive HIV test to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential infections.  Don't delay this.  A rapid test is available, but a confirmatory test (e.g., antibody test) is necessary for accurate diagnosis.\n",

      "    * **Thoroughly Examine Your Symptoms:** They’ll assess your physical symptoms, looking for patterns and correlations.\n",
      "    * **Review Your Medical History:**  They’ll ask about past infections, medications, and any other relevant medical conditions.\n",
      "    * **Run Additional Tests:** Based on the initial assessment, they might order blood tests to evaluate your immune system, look for signs of HIV, and test for other infections like syphilis or other STIs.\n",
      "    * **Consider a Nerve Diagnostic Test:** A nerve diagnostic test (like a nerve conduction study) could help determine if there's nerve damage related to the nerve infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Manage the Skin Infections:**  The blisters on your feet and the skin infections are likely related to the immune system response. Treatment will likely involve antifungal medications and possibly corticosteroids to manage inflammation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Address the Weakness:** The feeling of weakness could be linked to nerve dysfunction or a general impact on your nervous system.  This requires further investigation and potentially therapies to support nerve function.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Emotional Support:**  This is a very stressful situation.  It's understandable that you’re feeling anxious and fearful.  Seek support from a therapist or counselor to help you process these feelings and cope with the uncertainty.  Support groups for people with HIV or immune system issues can also be valuable.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Be Aware of Potential Risks:**  HIV can have long-term effects if not managed effectively.  It's essential to be proactive about your health and follow your doctor's recommendations carefully.\n",

Or you may have soft tissue tumor or cyst.  You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health. \n",

      "This sounds like a concerning situation. A hard, painful lump on the collarbone, especially with a burning sensation, coupled with a history of root canals and a recent job transition, warrants careful consideration. It’s good you’re addressing it proactively. Let’s break down potential causes, keeping in mind I'm an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses. Here’s a logical assessment considering your symptoms and history:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Possible Causes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Osteomyelitis (Bone Infection):** This is a significant possibility, particularly given the recent root canal history. Osteomyelitis occurs when bacteria enter the bone, causing inflammation and potentially leading to a bone infection.  The burning sensation could be related to inflammation.  It’s often associated with fever, chills, and tenderness.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Peritonsillar Abscess:** This is a collection of pus behind the tonsil, often causing a severe sore on the side of the neck. It can sometimes present with a lump and a burning sensation. The recent root canal history could make this a consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cervical Vertebral Infection:** While less likely given the lack of trauma, this is a possibility, especially if there is associated pain radiating into the shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Fibroma:** A benign (non-cancerous) tumor, often a soft, painless lump, can develop in the collarbone.  While often benign, they can sometimes become painful.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Muscle Strain or Torticollis:** A muscle strain or, more seriously, a spasm of the neck muscles could cause localized pain and a lump.  However, this is less likely to be the primary cause of the burning sensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Referred Pain:** Sometimes pain originating from another area can be felt in the collarbone. This is less probable, but possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations Given Your History:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Root Canals:** Root canals can, in rare cases, cause inflammation and osteomyelitis.\n",
      "*   **Recent Job Transition:** Significant stress and fatigue are common, and can sometimes lead to muscle tension and referred pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **See a Doctor (Immediately):**  This is crucial.  A doctor should examine the lump, assess the pain, and order appropriate tests.\n",
      "2.  **Diagnostic Tests:** The doctor might order:\n",
      "    *   **Blood Tests:** To check for infection, inflammation, and other potential problems.\n",
      "    *   **X-rays:** To look for bone infection, fractures, or other abnormalities.\n",
      "    *   **CT Scan:** In some cases, a CT scan might be necessary for a more detailed view of the bone.\n",
      "    *   **Swab for Culture:** To identify any bacteria.\n",
      "3.  **Pain Management:** While waiting for a diagnosis, you can try over-the-counter pain relievers (ibuprofen or acetaminophen) to manage the burning sensation.\n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "Hi thanks for asking question. The lung blockage could be possibly by mass that obstruct pathway. CT scan will suggest regarding whether it seems infective or neoplastic condition. If possible CT or USG guided FNAC can be taken to rule out nature if mass. Then according to report management done. This blockage if not by mass then fibrosis has to be ruled out caused by tuberculosis Like infection or any other fibrosis condition. CT scan and sputum examination will be helpful. Sometimes blockage may be by enlarge lymph node like Hilary node enlargement. If foreign body ingestion history present then it might lead such symptoms.

      "I have had a fluttering in my kidney region on the left side for the past day.  It is not painful.  I drink a lot of water throughout the day, work out five days a week, eat an extremely well-balanced meal, do not smoke or drink.  I have noticed the urge to urinate frequently which I thought was due to the large amounts of water I drink.  Please shed some light on what this fluttering can mean? The more it continues, it has made me more worried and concerned.  Thanks. \n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Hi, I can understand your concerns. Kidney conditions are not always very painful. Since an ultrasonogram is a very non-invasive, cheap but good diagnostic modality, I advise you to get an ultrasonogram of abdomen and check your urine microscopy. Any mild infection or mild obstruction in kidneys can cause your symptoms. Both these can be ruled out using the above said tests. I hope I have answered your query. Please feel free to get back to me if you need any further clarification or assistance. Wish you good health, Warm regards, \n",

      "The fluttering you’re experiencing in your left kidney region is a significant concern, and it’s understandable that you’re worried. While it’s good that you’ve been diligent about your diet and hydration, it’s important to investigate further. There are several potential causes, ranging from relatively benign to more serious. Let’s break down what could be going on:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Benign Parechymal Masses:** These are the most common cause of a fluttering sensation in the kidney region. They are fluid-filled sacs that form in the kidneys. They rarely cause symptoms, but they can be felt as a fluttering or fullness. They are often painless and can feel like a subtle, persistent pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI):** While you say you don’t smoke or drink, UTIs can sometimes present with a fluttering sensation, particularly in the lower abdomen. The frequent urination can be a symptom, and the feeling of fullness can mimic a mass.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Hormonal Changes:** Fluctuations in hormone levels, especially estrogen, can sometimes cause subtle changes in the kidney region, leading to a fluttering sensation. This is less common but possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Nerve Irritation:** Rarely, irritation of the nerves that supply the kidney region, perhaps due to compression or inflammation, can cause a fluttering sensation. This is less likely given your described symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Other, Less Common Causes:** In rare cases, other conditions can appear as a fluttering sensation, but these are less likely.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Psychological Factors:** While you mentioned it's not a primary concern, anxiety and stress can sometimes manifest physically, including subtle sensations in the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Given your description – the fluttering, the fact that it's not painful, and your overall lifestyle – it’s crucial to discuss this with a healthcare professional.** A doctor can perform a physical exam, which may include an ultrasound of the kidneys, to determine the cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Schedule an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible.** Explain your symptoms and concerns in detail.\n",

      "Hello. Thank you for writing to us at Chat Doctor I would keep a possibility of Intertwine, which is inflammation of the body folds. Intertwine clinically presents as red, moist, scaly, sore patches of skin on closely opposed body folds like maxilla, groins, submammary folds etc. Closely opposing body folds trap sweat and moisture and therefore make the area prone to inflammation from rubbing against each other. Candidal infection may superimpose (Candida Intertwine) thereby exacerbating the inflammation (redness and soreness). You may use an OTC topical antifungal e.g. clotrimazole 1% cream, twice daily in the affected folds for 4- 6\\u00a0weeks. If I was the treating doctor I would have also started you on oral antifungals e.g. Oral Fluconazole, in addition to the topical antifungal cream for 4-6 weeksOral antifungals are faster acting and better in controlling the candida super infection. Oral antifungals are prescription Chat Doctor. Once the condition has improved significantly on topical and oral antifungals (usually within 2-4 weeks), you may use an antifungal dusting powder e.g. clotrimazole dusting powder in the folds, twice daily, for maintenance of improvement.

It’s good you’re acknowledging these feelings and seeking help – that’s the first and most important step. Here’s a breakdown of what's happening and some practical suggestions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Understanding the Core Issues:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Stress & Anxiety:** The prolonged anxiety stemming from family problems, coupled with the lack of communication with your husband and feeling isolated, is a significant source of distress.\n",
      "* **Workplace Dissatisfaction:**  Being unhappy at work doesn't inherently mean you *need* a change, but it’s a contributing factor to the overall emotional burden.\n",
      "* **Loneliness & Isolation:** These feelings are deeply rooted and contribute powerfully to the cycle of anxiety and negative emotions.\n",

      "    * **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself. You’re struggling with a lot.  Recognize that feeling anxious and lonely is a *normal* response to difficult circumstances.\n",
      "    * **Journaling:**  Write down your thoughts and feelings – don't censor yourself. Just let it flow. This can be a powerful way to process emotions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Communication with Your Husband - A Crucial Step:** This is a big one.  You mentioned not sharing your problems. This is damaging your relationship and, more importantly, your self-care.\n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "Yes, heart rate can be elevated due to the impact of severe pain. The pain is also probably provoking anxiety. So you should seek treatment/medications to calm your system, such as antianxiety treatment. And since that involves seeing a doctor, you should be evaluated for inherent high blood pressure as well. And of course, better control of the pain will allow for less shock to your system, so getting back on your pain meds will help that also. \n",

      "This sounds like a very challenging and concerning situation. It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed and desperate for medical attention. Let’s break this down and explore some potential steps. Given the combination of symptoms – chronic pain, a herniated disc, a history of medication, a workcomp issue, and a search for a doctor – we need to approach this systematically.\n",
      "\n",
      "<SOLUTION>\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Immediately Contact Your Current Primary Care Physician (PCP):**  Even though you’ve been seeing them for a long time, this is the *most* crucial step. Explain your current distress, the erratic nature of the pain, and the difficulty you’re experiencing in finding a specialist.  They may be able to provide an urgent referral or suggest someone with experience in your specific symptoms. Don't hesitate to emphasize the work comp case – this adds urgency. Ask about telehealth options for a preliminary assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Explore Telehealth Options:** Many doctors now offer virtual appointments. This could be a way to get an initial assessment, discuss your concerns, and potentially schedule a follow-up with a specialist.  Look for providers in your area that offer this service.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Contact Your State's Medical Board:**  Given the length of your medical history (1989) and the medication history (opioids and muscle relaxers), it’s wise to check with your state’s medical board. They can verify your credentials and ensure they are properly licensed and qualified to manage the conditions you’re experiencing.  This can prevent potential complications and ensure you're receiving appropriate care.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider a Specialist Referral (Even with Legal Representation):**  Since you’re dealing with a workcomp case, a specialist (like a neurologist, physiatrist, or pain management specialist) might be better equipped to address your specific needs. While you have an attorney, it's good to have a second opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Request a Diagnostic Evaluation:**  Request a comprehensive evaluation to thoroughly assess your condition. This should include:\n",
      "   * **MRI or CT Scan:** To visualize the herniated disc and identify any other potential issues.\n",
      "   * **Neurological Exam:**  To assess your reflexes, sensory function, and coordination.\n",
      "   * **Blood Tests:**  To rule out other underlying conditions.\n",

      "8. **Work Comp Considerations:**  Document the details of your work comp case thoroughly.  Your attorney can assist you in understanding the requirements and procedures involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Note:**  Given your history with medication, it’s vital to have a thorough discussion with your doctor (and a specialist) about the potential risks and benefits of continued medication use.

It suggests a potential issue with liver function, and the symptoms you’re describing – abdominal pain, difficulty getting up, and persistent lower abdominal pain – are highly suggestive of liver issues. Let’s break down the possible causes and what needs to happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "<SOLUTION>\n",
      "\n",
      "**Immediate Actions & Next Steps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Schedule an Appointment with a Doctor ASAP:** This is absolutely crucial. You need to see a doctor – ideally a gastroenterologist or a hepatologist (a specialist in liver disease). Don’t delay.  Don’t rely solely on online information; a physical examination and diagnostic testing are essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Diagnostic Tests:**  The doctor will likely order several tests to determine the underlying cause. These could include:\n",
      "   * **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** To assess for anemia, which can sometimes be associated with liver problems.\n",
      "   * **Liver Function Tests (LFTs):** This is *critical*.  They will check:\n",
      "      * **ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase):**  Elevated ALT suggests liver cell damage.\n",
      "      * **AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase):**  Generally, AST is more reactive than ALT, but both need to be assessed.\n",
      "      * **Bilirubin:**  To assess bilirubin levels, which can be elevated in liver disease.\n",
      "      * **Albumin:**  A measure of protein in the blood, which can be low in liver disease.\n",
      "   * **Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (SGPT) & GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transfructaminase):**  These are secondary tests.  Elevated SGPT/GGT *suggests* a problem with the bile ducts, which can be part of a larger liver issue.  The doctor will consider the results in the context of your other symptoms and medical history.\n",
      "   * **Ultrasound of the Liver:** This is often the initial imaging test to look for structural abnormalities in the liver.\n",
      "   * **Imaging (CT Scan or MRI):** Depending on the initial findings, a CT scan or MRI of the abdomen might be necessary to look for other causes of abdominal pain, such as gallbladder issues, tumors, or other structural abnormalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Address Potential Causes (While Waiting for Diagnosis):**  Based on the test results, the doctor will investigate potential causes.  Possible culprits include:\n",
      "   * **Alcohol Abuse:** Even if you don’t drink, excessive alcohol consumption can cause liver damage.\n",
      "   * **Viral Hepatitis (A, B, C):**  These infections can cause significant liver inflammation and damage.\n",
      "   * **Autoimmune Liver Diseases:** Conditions like autoimmune hepatitis can attack the liver.\n",
      "   * **Drug-Induced Liver Injury:** Certain medications can damage the liver.\n",
      "   * **Bile Duct Obstruction:** Blocked bile ducts (e.g., by gallstones) can cause abdominal pain and potentially affect SGPT levels.\n",
      "   * **Medication-Induced Liver Damage:** A side effect of certain medications could be contributing.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Lifestyle Adjustments (While Waiting for Diagnosis):** *Important note: These are supportive measures, not a cure.*\n",
      "   * **Diet:** A healthy, balanced diet is important, focusing on lean protein, fruits, and vegetables.  Limit processed foods, saturated fats, and alcohol.\n",

      "The presented symptoms – foot pain upon standing, relieved with movement, and pain after prolonged sitting – strongly suggest an issue with the lower back muscles and/or the nerves that supply them. The pain radiating down the foot is a classic sign of referred pain. The pain being relieved by movement points towards a musculoskeletal problem.  Given the duration of the problem and the limitations of the provided information, several possibilities exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "<SOLUTION>\n",
      "Here’s a breakdown of potential causes and what you can do:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Possible Causes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Lower Back Muscle Strain/Spasm:** This is the most likely culprit. The muscles in your lower back (particularly the erector spinae) could be tight or spasmed, causing referred pain to your feet.\n",
      "2.  **Sciatica:** This is a common condition where the sciatic nerve, which runs from your lower back down your leg, is compressed or irritated. This can lead to pain radiating down the leg and foot.\n",
      "3.  **Foot Tendon Issues:**  Weakened or inflamed tendons in the foot (especially the Achilles tendon or plantar fascia) could contribute to the pain.\n",
      "4.  **Nerve Compression:**  Less likely given the described scenario, but a potential cause could be compression of a nerve in the spine or pelvic region.\n",
      "5.  **Hip/Pelvic Dysfunction:**  Problems with the hips and pelvis can sometimes affect the way nerves and muscles are activated in the lower extremities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What You Can Do to Relieve the Pain:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Rest and Activity Modification:** Avoid activities that aggravate the pain.  Short, gentle walks are generally better than prolonged sitting.\n",
      "2. **Gentle Stretching:** Focus on stretching the muscles in your lower back, hamstrings, and calves.  Examples include:\n",
      "    *   **Knee-to-Chest Stretch:** Lie on your back and gently pull one knee towards your chest.\n",
      "    *   **Piriformis Stretch:** Lie on your back with your knees bent. Cross one ankle over the opposite knee and gently pull the uncrossed leg towards your chest.\n",
      "3. **Ice and Heat:**  Apply ice packs for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day, to the affected area. After the initial inflammation subsides, you can switch to heat (warm bath or heating pad) for relaxation.\n",

      "******************** Question:\n",
      "Hello I am a male teenager and I have a little not so secret thing I want to talk about. You may know that masturbation is very common and perfectly normal but in my case I just simply dont like doing it. I am not an addict but whenever I get sexual thoughts I just cant help myself and do it. (once a day to once a week) and twice a day in rare cases. Its just simply not within my morales to do this and I need advice to get rid of the urge when time comes thank you. \n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "HelloThanks for query, You are in a teenage and get strong urge to masturbate. Masturbation is natural desire of a man to get sexual satisfaction without female partner and there is nothing abnormal in practicing it. It does not cause damage to any organ or system in body However though it is harmless, excessive and frequent habitual masturbation does affect quality of erection and delays ejaculation. It requires self-determination to stop or control this habit of frequent habitual masturbation. Try to reduce the frequency of masturbation by keeping yourself busy in activities like sports, reading, painting or social work etc. so that you will not get free time to masturbate. Chat Doctor. \n",
      "Response:\n",
      "<start_working_out>\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, this is a really common and understandable struggle. It sounds like you’re experiencing a significant challenge with impulses and potentially some underlying anxiety or discomfort. Let’s break this down and explore some potential approaches. It’s great that you’re acknowledging the difficulty and seeking advice – that’s the first step to feeling better.\n",
      "\n",
      "<SOLUTION>\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s a multi-faceted approach that might be helpful, and it’s important to remember this is not a quick fix, but a process of learning and adapting:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Understanding the Root Cause:** Your feelings of discomfort and inability to control these urges are key. It’s crucial to understand *why* you feel this compulsion. Are you experiencing stress, anxiety, low self-esteem, loneliness, or something else?  Often, these urges are linked to underlying emotional needs.  Journaling about these feelings can be surprisingly helpful.  Simply writing down your thoughts and experiences without judgment can reveal patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Mindfulness & Awareness:**  You've already identified this, which is fantastic.  Regular mindfulness practices – even 5-10 minutes a day – can significantly improve your ability to observe your thoughts and feelings without judgment.  Focus on your breath, your senses, or a simple activity. When you notice an urge surfacing, acknowledge it without acting on it. Just say to yourself, \"I'm noticing this urge, and I'm aware of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Distraction Techniques:**  When a strong urge arises, immediately try a distraction. This is *not* about trying to *avoid* the urge, but about diverting your attention. Ideas include:\n",
      "    * **Physical Activity:** Exercise, a walk, dancing – anything that gets your body moving.\n",
      "    * **Hobbies:** Engage in activities you enjoy – reading, playing a game, crafting, listening to music.\n",
      "    * **Social Connection:** Talk to a trusted friend or family member – distracting conversation can help.\n",
      "    * **Mindful Activities:**  Focusing on a specific task like cooking, cleaning, or doing a puzzle offers a different kind of engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cognitive Restructuring:**  Challenge the thoughts that fuel the urge. Are you catastrophizing (\"I'll lose control!\")? Are you telling yourself that it's inherently wrong?  Replace these negative thoughts with more balanced and realistic ones (\"I'm feeling anxious right now, and it’s okay to feel that way, but I can manage it\").  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques can be very helpful here.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Seek Professional Support:** This is really important.  A therapist, particularly one with experience in anxiety or impulse control, can provide tailored guidance and support.  They can help you explore the root causes of your urges, teach you coping skills, and work with you to develop a long-term plan.  You can find therapists through your insurance provider or online directories.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Self-Compassion:**  Be kind to yourself.  It takes time and effort to change ingrained patterns.  Don't beat yourself up if you slip up.  Acknowledge the setback, learn from it, and refocus on your goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Important Note:** If you are experiencing thoughts of harming yourself or others, please reach out for immediate help.  Here are some resources:\n",
      "   * **The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline:** 988\n",
      "   * **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741\n",
      "   * **The Trevor Project:** 1-866-488-7386 (for LGBTQ youth)\n",
